# Weather app

The first real android app that me and university friend made for a project. We used Openweathermap's API for this project. The app has a simple registration and login pages just because there was a requrement to use database in the project.

# Main page

After logging in the first time you get for permission for the app to check your location so it can load the weather information about your current city. I live in Varna so in my case it loaded Varna's information.

If you want to see the information about different city , just type the city name in the search bar and press search.
